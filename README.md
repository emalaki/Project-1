# Project-1
In this project, we used some sources from the internet to aid with the code we wanted to write. I used chatgpt and I also referrenced a few of my old homework assignments. 
My role in this project was to answer the question of "Are microplastic levels rising in the ocean?" I did this all in my own notebook. 
I also created the presentation, however I only worked on the slides that answer my own question.
