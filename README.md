#Microplastics in the Oceans

This analysis seeks to raise awareness and describe the number of microplastics in the world's oceans.

The NOAA Marine Debris Program was used as a source of information, which collected data on the number of microplastics (pieces/m3) in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Arctic oceans. The sampling methods used are Neuston net, Aluminum bucket, Grab sample, intake seawater, manta net, and plankton net.

The study shows information regarding the amount of sampling in the global oceans, the influence of the sampling method on the results, the uniformity of years, and the distribution of microplastics in two points of garbage patches in the global ocean.
